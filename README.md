# Project Title: LTM Enhancement for COVID-19 Modeling

## Overview
This project aims to develop and enhance a Linear Threshold Model (LTM) for simulating the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission within the US population. The LTM is designed to emulate individual-level variability in susceptibility and integrate it with the SIR model for more accurate predictions.

## How to Run

The code is put in both an .ipynb and .py format, whichever you prefer to run.

1. Change directory into ```SRC```
2. Create a python environment with ```python -m venv <name>```
3. Activate the environment in CLI with  ```source <name>/bin/activate```. If on windows run ```.\<name>\Scripts\activate```
4. Install all required packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run python file or open ipynb file to run through our code and output the model evaluations, graphs, and data statistics.
