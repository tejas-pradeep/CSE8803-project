# Project Title: LTM Enhancement for COVID-19 Modeling

## Overview
This project aims to develop and enhance a Linear Threshold Model (LTM) for simulating the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission within the US population. The LTM is designed to emulate individual-level variability in susceptibility and integrate it with the SIR model for more accurate predictions.
